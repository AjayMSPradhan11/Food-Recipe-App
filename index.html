                            <br>Heat oil in a wide pan. Using a ladle, pour the batter in a circle shape into the hot oil.
                            
                            <br>Reduce the flame to medium and let it cook on one side. Flip it to the other side using a tong. Fry till it gets light golden brown from both sides.
                            
                            <br>Remove and drain on an absorbent paper. Store them in an air tight container once they cool down completely.

They are nibble-estimated dumplings made with a spoonful of stuffing wrapped in the batter. Momos are generally steamed, however, they are once in a while seared or steam-singed. The filling of meat or vegetables winds up succulent as it creates a seriously enhanced soup fixed inside the wrappers. </p>

                            <br>To make the wrappers: Break off 1/2 ounce of dough and forming it into a ball. Place the ball on a flat surface and roll it into a 4-inch round with a rolling pin. Repeat with the remaining dough.
                            <br>Spray a steamer pan with cooking spray.
                            <br>Place a tablespoon of the chicken filling in the middle of a wrapper. Holding the wrapper in your left hand. Use your right thumb and index finger to start pinching the edges of the wrapper together. Pinch and fold until the edges of the circle close up like a little satchel. Place the momo in the prepared steamer pan. Repeat with remaining wrappers and filling.
                            <br>Fill the steamer pot halfway with water and bring to a boil. Set the steamer pan with the momos on top of the pot and cover with a tight lid. Steam the momos until cooked, 8 to 9 minutes.

                        <p class="meal-descript-about">In cuisine, an omelette is a dish made from beaten eggs, fried with butter or oil in a frying pan. It is quite common for the omelette to be folded around fillings such as chives, vegetables, mushrooms, meat, cheese, onions or some combination of the above.

                    <div class = "meal-instruct">
                        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                        <p><br>3 eggs, beaten
                            <br>1 tsp sunflower oil
                            <br>1 tsp butter
                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>1. Beat the eggs: Use two or three eggs per omelette, depending on how hungry you are. Beat the eggs lightly with a fork.
                            2. Melt the butter: Use an 8-inch nonstick skillet for a 2-egg omelette, a 9-inch skillet for 3 eggs. Melt the butter over medium-low heat, and keep the temperature low and slow when cooking the eggs so the bottom doesn’t get too brown or overcooked.
                            3. Add the eggs: Let the eggs sit for a minute, then use a heatproof silicone spatula to gently lift the cooked eggs from the edges of the pan. Tilt the pan to allow the uncooked eggs to flow to the edge of the pan.
                            4. Fill the omelette: Add the filling—but don’t overstuff the omelette—when the eggs begin to set. Cook for a few more seconds
                            5. Fold and serve: Fold the omelette in half. Slide it onto a plate with the help of a silicone spatula.

                        <p><br>1. If your chicken breasts are too big, slice them before cooking. Then, marinade the chicken breasts in the Worcestershire sauce, pepper, salt, mustard, or all-spice powder. Leave the chicken for at least four hours or over night.
                            <br>2. An egg and two tablespoons of water should be beaten together to make the batter, which should then be set aside.
                            <br>3. Chicken breasts that have been marinated should be heavily dusted in flour. They should be well coated after being dipped in both the egg and the breadcrumbs.
                            <br>4. The coated chicken breasts should be deep-fried in heated oil over a medium-high heat until they are crisp and golden brown.
                            <br>5. The finished burger should be stacked with the lettuce on top, followed by the chicken, and then the mayonnaise or KFC zinger sauce. The buns should be cut in half and lightly toasted. If you'd like a cheesy kick, add some sliced American cheese.

                            <li>1 teaspoon turmeric</li>
                            <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
                            <li>1 teaspoon timur (Szechwan pepper)</li>
                            <li>2 tablespoons hot chili paste</li>
                            <li>5 tablespoons mustard oil</li>
                            <li>Pinch of asafetida</li>
                            <li>Salt to taste</li>
                            
                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><li>In a large bowl, combine daikon with one tablespoon of salt and let rest for at least four hours.</li>
                            <li>This process accomplishes the extraction of water from daikon.
                                Press daikon pieces between palms to squeeze water as much as possible.</li>
                            <li>Reserve in a bowl.</li>
                            <li>To this, add ground musturd, paprika, timur, chili paste, mustard oil, asafetida and salt.</li>
                            <li>Be careful in adding excessive amount of salt as daikon had already been blanched in salt.</li>
                            <li>Mix all ingredients thoroughly.</li>
                            <li>Put the daikon mixture in a sterilized jar; close lid and allow to rest in a warm place for at least three days for fermentation before serving.</li>
                            <li>Refrigerate to store.</li>

                        <p class="meal-descript-about">Dalle Khursani (round chili) is one of the hottest chilies found in the world. It is also commonly called Akbare khursani. There is another variety super hot chili commonly found in Nepal called Jeere Khursani, a very tiny chili but has extreme heat, which name derives from its size similar to cumin (Jeera).

                            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
                            
                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><li>Wash the Dalle Khursani (chillies) thoroughly, remove the stems and keep them aside.</li>
                            <li>Peel and finely chop the garlic cloves.</li>
                            <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a pan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the chopped garlic and sauté until it turns golden brown.</li>
                            <li>Add the Dalle Khursani to the pan and sauté for about 5 minutes until they become soft.</li>
                            <li>Chop the tomato and add it to the pan. Cook until the tomato becomes soft and mushy.</li>
                            <li>Add the turmeric powder, cumin powder, and salt. Mix well and continue to cook for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
                            <li>Remove the pan from the heat and allow the mixture to cool down.</li>
                            <li>Once cooled, transfer the mixture into a blender or a mortar and pestle. Blend or crush until you get a coarse paste.</li>
                            <li>Transfer the paste into a serving dish. Your Dalle Khursani is ready to be served. Enjoy it with rice, roti, or any other main course dishes.</li>
